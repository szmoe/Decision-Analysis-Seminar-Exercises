# Testing with make_variables ####

# You could simply start further developing the decision model now, 
# but since the model function will be designed to make use of variables 
# provided to it externally (random numbers drawn according to 
# the information in the data table), you will need to define 
# sample values for all variables, if you want to test pieces of 
# the function code during the development process. 
# This can be done manually, but itâ€™s more easily accomplished with 
# the following helper function make_variables:

make_variables <- function(est,n=1)
{ x<-random(rho=est, n=n)
for(i in colnames(x)) assign(i,
                             as.numeric(x[1,i]),envir=.GlobalEnv)
}

# Applying make_variables and as.estimate to the data table 
# (with default setting n=1) generates one random number for each variable,
# which then allows you to easily test the code you are developing.
# Try running this function on your code as you build the decision function.
# This allows for testing the values within a model rather 
# than running the full model.

# Run the make_variables and as.estimate on the input_estimates input table
# that we created and then calculate the result of Labor_cost + Management_cost
# given a single random value for these variables. 
# Note that each time you run this code it generates a new random draw
# and produces a different number from within the range for the variables 
# in the input table.

# The overall plot only shows those variables with a VIP > 0.8, 
# which is the common threshold for variable selection E. Luedeling 
# and Shepherd (2016). The colors of the bars represent the positive 
# or negative coefficient of the given input variable with the output variable.

# Here we import the input table again to replace the labels for the variables 
# on the y-axis. The input table can include a â€˜labelâ€™ and â€˜variableâ€™ column. 
# The standard labels (from the â€˜variableâ€™ column) are usually

# is incurred when the decision-maker does not have perfect information about 
# a particular variable. EVPI is determined by examining the influence of 
# that variable on the output value of a decision model.

# We use the function data.frame() to transform the x and y outputs of
# the mcSimulation() function for EVPI calculation. We use the multi_EVPI() 
# function to calculate the EVPI for multiple independent variables.
# For the first_out_var argument we choose â€˜intervention_mngmt_audit_costâ€™ 
# from the input table since this is the first variable after the NPV and 
# cashflow model outputs, which we would like to exclude from the EVPI analysis.

# on the variables that the user wants)
